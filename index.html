<p>Hi! I'm Devon, I'm an avid developer, and have a huge interest in things like operating systems (Android, Windows)/ any kind of technology at all, 40+ world records across select games, and a love for company mascots like Mitu and Bugdroid! (I also used to do some photography)</p>

<p>I've had a love for Android and Windows since I was very young. I enjoyed TouchWiz UI on Samsung devices, like the Galaxy Tab 10.1 and Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 since I was 2-3,
and looking back, it's still a very comforting and pleasing aesthetic to me. When I was around 7-8, I started flashing custom ROMS for my tablets and phone I had at the time, and also modified them in different ways. 
I also have enjoyed messing with Windows in the same timeframe, using custom ISO's and modifying stock ones as well. I also started using different operating systems in Virtualbox around the same time, testing out various Linux distributions and Windows versions. 
Around ~2023, I found a game on Roblox called "ball and axe" from a friend, and it became the first game I persued to become extremely good at, getting my first world record in under a month of playing. 
Now, I hold a majority of the world records there, and many more in similar-styled games, like Getting Over It: Remastered, and block and hammer. 
I've settled down on gaming, and now have focused more on my love for Android, and it's mascot Bugdroid especially, Mitu, the Xiaomi mascot, and college!
With my love for Bugdroid recently blooming, I've been purchasing different <a href="https://bugdroid.org/toys/plushies/dead-zebra-plushie">Dead Zebra Plushies</a>, and plan to get every single variation
a year or two from now (<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iiSpectre/Dead-Zebra-Android-Plush-Archive/refs/heads/main/All%20Together.jpg">I have 4 as of right now!</a>). I may also get a
Mitu plushie in the near future!</p>
