            <p>2 years in the making, this is my most impressive world record by far! I really enjoy playing this game, and spent a long time becoming one of the best players, with a majority of the world records.</p>

            <p>It didn't take me too much time, but I was the first person, after 14 years, to reach max score in this game mode without pauses on every pose!</p>

                <p>I have many world records across different games, some more impressive than others, or just not meant to be taken seriously (you'll notice a common pattern, either ball and axe, or a game related to Getting Over It lol.)</p>

                <p>I have a big involvement in personal projects regarding Android, and this is my first fully-fledged ROM I made for my own device! I debloated it to an extent and added my own custom wallpaper, it's experimental, but everything works just fine.</p>
