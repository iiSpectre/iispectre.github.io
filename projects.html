            <p>I'm currently working on some projects, like:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Custom ROMS for my Galaxy S4 I9500 and my <a href="https://xdaforums.com/t/rom-debloated-deodexed-5-0-2-stock-samsung-lollipop-for-galaxy-tab-4-sm-t530nu.4775998/">Galaxy Tab 4</a>, which I plan to release with multiple different builds, some coming with GAPPS or not, extreme debloat, etc.</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    A repository containing <a href="https://github.com/iiSpectre/Bugdroid-Renders">Bugdroid Renders</a> across various ROMS, mainly using simg2img to make the images mountable in Ubuntu / extractable in Windows, and my own tool!
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://github.com/iiSpectre/APK-Extraction-Script">An APK Extraction Tool</a>, which primarily grabs media, like images, videos, and audio, and puts them into categorized folders. One of the main reasons I made it was to find any renders of Bugdroid inside, which has helped me with the previously mentioned project!</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    As well as <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/96045448107479/Community-And-Axe">Community And Axe</a>, a fangame of ball and axe with many more features, and different community members' maps. Once everyone completes their part, it'll be a huge megacollab from all the members in the community!
                    </a>
                </li>
            </ul>
